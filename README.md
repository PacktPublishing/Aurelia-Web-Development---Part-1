## About the Video Course
Aurelia is a modern, forward-thinking, conventions-based JavaScript framework that leverages web standards. Aurelia itself is developed using ES2016 and comprises smaller, focused modules.

This video course starts by ensuring you have a basic understanding of Aurelia, walking you through a todo list application and setting up the development environment. We 'll take you through a modern web application and move on to talk about tools, modules, web standards, and testing. 

Moving on, we take you on a whirlwind tour of Aurelia’s features in order to create a todo application project. After that, you’ll get an understanding of how to persist todos, routing, using pub/sub for communications. At the end, we throw light on dependency injection, declarative registration, explicit registration, and resolvers.

This course will provide you with step-by-step practical knowledge of how to develop an application using Aurelia web development.
